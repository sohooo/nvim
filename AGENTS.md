## Running Tests

After making changes to the configuration or scripts, you can verify that Neovim starts successfully by running the test script `tests/run.sh`:

   ```bash
   tests/run.sh
   ```

This script will run Neovim in headless mode to ensure that the startup process completes without errors.
